# MatLabPlotPractice  
I am trying to learn MatLab in case I study signals and filters in grad school  
ElectricalPlot.m: Basic data loading and ploting  
NyAudio.m: Read audio data and uses fft commands to demostrate Nyquist Theorem  
Stellar.m: Mathmaitical commands that prove red shift  
All the data for the "load" instructions is from https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/R2017b/portal.html?course=gettingstarted&s_tid=mlac_gettingstarted_bod
